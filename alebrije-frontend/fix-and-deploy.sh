Now you need to deploy to your original Netlify site:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/xolo-inu/deploys
2. Click 'Deploy manually'
3. Drag and drop the dist folder from:
   /Users/rastavo/xolo-project/xolo-frontend/dist

We've also created a backup at:
/Users/rastavo/xolo-project/xolo-frontend/backup_dist

=======================================================

Do you want to open the Netlify deploy page now? (y/n)"

read -p "> " OPEN_NETLIFY

if [[ $OPEN_NETLIFY == "y" || $OPEN_NETLIFY == "Y" ]]; then
  open https://app.netlify.com/sites/xolo-inu/deploys
  open /Users/rastavo/xolo-project/xolo-frontend/dist
  echo "Opened Netlify deploy page and dist folder!"
fi

echo "âœ… Script completed successfully!"
